About

I believe that IT is more about craftsmanship rather about science
or art. For me it's similar to cooking. Anyone who try to make omelette know
that good kitchen and proper equipments are very crucial.  This repository
contain small but critical configs for widely used toolsets.  *But remember
"Your Hands Are Your Best Tools"*

Toolset

### ZSH

Default shell for MacOS X is BASH. By default old version of bash installed but it's not very critical. But because friend of mine recomended to change my default shell to zsh "just for fun" and because "it's looks coll" I  do it and now I see no reasons to back to bash. For my "kitchen" I'm using:
 
* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your ZSH configuration.	
* oh-my-zsh [themes](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes) preview will be useful to review
* zsh [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) plugin not included to oh-my-zsh by default but it very useful to have one.

### tmux

If you know about screen utility [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net) wouldn't be very strange for you. Biggest disadvantage of tmux comparing to screen is that session recording is awful. But in pair with [tmuxinator](https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator) it's lovely windows organiser with lot of potential to customisations.
