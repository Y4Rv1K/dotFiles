I believe that IT is more about craftsmanship rather about science
or art. For me it's similar to cooking. Anyone who try to make omelette know
that good kitchen and proper equipments are very crucial.  This repository
contain small but critical configs for widely used toolsets.  *But remember
"Your Hands Are Your Best Tools"*

Toolset

### ZSH

Default shell for MacOS X is BASH. By default old version of bash installed but it's not very critical. But because friend of mine recomended to change my default shell to zsh "just for fun" and because "it's looks coll" I  do it and now I see no reasons to back to bash. For my "kitchen" I'm using [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) to install and manage everething using one .zshrc file 

### alacritty 

To manage feel and looks accross all Linux/Unix platfrom I'm using:

- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) as terminal emulator 
- color schema [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com)
- Fonts from [JetBrain](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
